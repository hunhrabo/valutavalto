This is a basic React App

Feel free to clone it on your desktop and make changes.

Version 0.1.0 uses an XML document as database for the currency data.
Fully functional app - that uses the third-party API - coming later.

When you cloned the project on your computer, navigate to the project's directory and install it by typing

### `npm install`

then start the app:

### `npm start`

PS. The language of the app is Hungarian, in case you didn't understand it :)

Thanks!
